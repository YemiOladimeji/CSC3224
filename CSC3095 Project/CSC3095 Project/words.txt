The Kinect’s fidelity was assessed and it was deemed as a suitable piece of technology to base the project around. The software development kit contained all the necessary tools to record and create new gestures such as Kinect Studio and Visual Gesture Builder. With a database of new gestures, exercises could then effectively be created by asking the user to repeat these motions in front of the Kinect.
Another one of the objectives was to successfully implement a type of validation, so that only gestures which were close to the original recording would be accepted as a successful repetition. By utilising the confidence value (a number ranging from 0 to 1) associated with every gesture, the accuracy of the gesture performed can be evaluated as being successful or not depending on what the value is.
